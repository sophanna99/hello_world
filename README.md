# hello_world
my first repository 
This is my first repository in github and i'm really excited for this project !!
I'm a 4th year chemical engineer student at UC San Diego who is really interested in renewable enegry including fuel cell and solar cell.
In addition, I also have an interest in software engineering which keeps me taking more CS classes at UCSD.
